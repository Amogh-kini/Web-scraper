# Web Scraper Collection

This repository contains two beginner-friendly web scraping projects:

- **Try 1:** Scraper for [Internshala](https://internshala.com) using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`
- **Try 2:** Scraper for [Amazon](https://amazon.com) using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`

Both scrapers are templates and **can be easily modified** for scraping other websites.

---

⚠️ **Important Warning**  
These scrapers rely on the current HTML structure of the target websites.  
- If the website changes its design, class names, or HTML tags, the scripts may **stop working**.
- You can easily **update the class names and HTML tags** inside the code to make it work again.
